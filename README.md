# CleanArchitecture
This projects demostrate a clean architecture implementation.
An api from "https://dummyjson.com/products" is called and the result are demostrated.
The app is testable because of the separation of concerns, where the business logic and the UI is separated so that every part of the code is tested flexibly.
